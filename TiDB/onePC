The core of 2PC logic is in twoPhaseCommitter insert sqlï¼Œprewrite regions question

1PC Decision Logic:
1pc is only possible when all keys touched by a transaction are in the same region and binlog is not being used.
TiDB then sets try_one_pc in the prewrite message to true Async commit - TiKV sig-transaction documentation.

Prewrite Request Flag:
The key mechanism is the try_one_pc flag in the prewrite request. When TiDB determines that a transaction is
eligible for 1PC, it sets this flag to true in the prewrite message sent to TiKV.

Response Handling:
When TiKV successfully commits a transaction in 1PC, the one_pc_commit_ts field in the PrewriteResponse will
be set to tell TiDB the final commit_ts. Sometimes TiKV may fail to commit the transaction by 1PC, but it's
able to prewrite it in normal 2PC way. In this case, the one_pc_commit_ts will be zero to indicate that TiDB
still needs to proceed on the 2PC procedure 1PC .


The 1PC optimization is integrated into the existing 2PC infrastructure, with the code changes scattered 1PC.
